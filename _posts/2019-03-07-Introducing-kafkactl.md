We have recently open-sourced a tool called kafkactl. The sources can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/deviceinsight/kafkactl). kafkactl is a command
line tool for managing an Apache Kafka cluster.

The motivation for creating this is that using Apache Kafka's own command
line tools can be quite cumbersome: Things like the broker or Zookeeper addresses have
to be configured for each invocation. There is also no command line completion
that one has come to expect from moden command line tools.

To be continued...
